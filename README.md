- 2FA verification flow  
- Session persistence (save/load)
- Compatible with Python-saved sessions
- **Device listing with RC4 encrypted API** (‚úÖ NEW!)
- Retrieves all owned and shared devices
- Extracts device tokens, IPs, MACs, and other info

### Technical Implementation

1. **Authentication**: Matches Python implementation exactly
   - Three-step login process
   - 2FA support with identity verification
   - Session cookie management

2. **RC4 Encrypted API**: Full implementation of Python's encrypted API calls
   - RC4 encryption/decryption for requests and responses
   - SHA1-based signature generation for encrypted calls
   - Supports all v2 API endpoints

3. **Signature Generation**:
   - Nonce: 8 random bytes + 4 time bytes (big-endian)
   - Signed nonce: SHA256(base64_decode(ssecurity) + base64_decode(nonce))
   - Regular signature: HMAC-SHA256 with signed_nonce as key
   - Encrypted signature: SHA1 hash of method|path|params|signed_nonce

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/v2/homeroom/gethome` - Get user's homes
   - `/v2/home/home_device_list` - Get devices for a home
   - `/v2/user/get_device_cnt` - Validate session and get device counts

5. **Required Headers & Cookies**:
   - `MIOT-ENCRYPT-ALGORITHM: ENCRYPT-RC4`
   - `x-xiaomi-protocal-flag-cli: PROTOCAL-HTTP2`
